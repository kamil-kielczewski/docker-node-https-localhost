# Node.js service template via HTTPS powerd by Docker

This is only template for node service working on HTTPS localhost

## Run

Run below command once or twice:

```
docker compsose up
```

Then you can open browser at: https://localhost

This will create folder: ./cert/CA with rootCA.pem certificate.

## Mac Os

We need to add info to system (MacOS) that it is trusted certificate.

To add the rootCA.pem certificate generated by mkcert to the macOS trusted certificates, which will make pages using certificates issued by this CA to be considered trusted in the Chrome browser, follow these steps:

1. Open Keychain Access
   Open Finder, navigate to Applications > Utilities, and launch Keychain Access. You can also use Spotlight (Cmd + Space), type in Keychain Access, and press Enter.
2. Add the CA certificate to the system keychain
   In Keychain Access, select the system keychain (System) from the list on the left side.
   Drag the rootCA.pem file from the ./certs/CA/ location onto the list of certificates in Keychain Access, or use the File > Import Items... menu and locate the rootCA.pem file.
   After importing the certificate, it should appear on the list. Admin password may be required to approve the import.
3. Set the certificate as trusted
   Locate the newly imported CA certificate in Keychain Access. It should be marked as mkcert development CA.
   Double-click the certificate to open the details window.
   Expand the Trust section.
   In the When using this certificate section, select Always Trust.
   Close the certificate details window. The system may ask for the admin password to save the changes.
4. Restart the browser
   To ensure the changes to the trusted certificates are recognized by the Chrome browser, restart it.
5. Verify the page
   After restarting the browser, visit your page running on https://localhost. It should now be considered trusted, without any warnings about the untrusted certificate.

If warnings still appear, ensure that the server is using certificates generated by mkcert and the CA has been correctly added to the system keychain and set as trusted.
